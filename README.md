# Mapgen Presets Fixes
A mod for the game Factorio, fixing and adding missing mapgen presets for other mods' resources.

Some of the mods commonly known as Bob's Mods, Angel's, and MadClown's add resources to the game. Some of those resources have configured mapgen presets that align with the original game and each other, for non-Default settings such as Rich Resources or Rail World. However not all of them are included in this reconfiguration, possibly due to oversight or infrequent use of those settings by the mod authors. This mod implements the missing settings, as faithfully to the comparable existing settings as possible.
